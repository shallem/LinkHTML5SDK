Demo app for Mobile Helix SDK
=============================

This is an HTML5 chat client, meant to demonstrate the offline capabilities provided by the Mobile Helix SDK. The chat client is by no means a fully functional chat client, but feel free to help us make it better.

The server is currently hosted by Openshift, written in PHP using CakePHP with a MySQL back end. You need credentials to log into the chat client - please contact @html5appman or email ilya@mobilehelix.com.

Once you have credentials, you can log into the chat client here:

The full documentation for the SDK is in the /doc folder. 

To get started with the SDK please see this presentation (as presented at jQuery Con 2014 in Chicago):
